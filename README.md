The most challenging part of this whole project, was grid layouts. I chose the Bento Style design because I really wanted to challenge myself with this, since I don't normally use grids in my designs. I feel like this was the best way to go, because I didn't want to do something I have done a million times, something new is what I needed. Also I haven't used tailwind in about 2 years, and even then I only had basic knowledge on how to use it, so that was also a challenging. 

Since I don't have a strong foundation with tailwindcss, I took the approach of reverse engineering. Basically I created the project like I normally would, when you include a css file, and then from there I started building out, to the best of my ability, what it would be in tailwindcss. It helps me visualize things better and get a handle on what I'm doing...though it can be kind of time consuming.

Just figuring out how to properly do the columns, I'm not happy about how they came out. But also I didn't want to waste time with trying to figure it out and get super frustrated in the process. I shutdown a few times on this project, as well as started it over 3 times...one of those times I even chose a different project altogether. But yeah I would work on that more than anything else.
